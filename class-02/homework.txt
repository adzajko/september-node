1. Create a node server that runs on the 8080 port.
2. Define an object with 6 properties and an array with 7 members in a separate file and export them.
3. Create a separate file for writing and reading files
4. Define a write File function that uses the fs.writeFile() to write to a file. This function should be able to write to many different files
    (Hint: the path of the file should be passed as an argument)
5. Create a readFile function that uses the fs.readFile() to read contents of a file. Just like the write function it should work with many different file paths.
6. Include both functions, the array and the object in the main app file, and write their contents to two different files
    (So, the contents of the object should be written to a file like object.txt, and the array contents to array.text)
7. Read the file contents of both file.
