1. Create a http server running on port 3000
2. Install and configure express in your application
3. Create the following requests: 

   GET /songs which should return any Query Params sent to it as the response.
    In the case of no query params, an error response should be sent back. (Hint: 4xx status codes )

    POST /detectives which should parse the incoming request body and write it to a file using filesystem. 
        The response should be 201 if the writing op is successful and 500 if otherwise
        (Hint: the response should only be sent after the file write operation finishes using async / await or .then())
